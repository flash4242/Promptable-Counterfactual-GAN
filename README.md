# Promptable Counterfactual GAN

## Project details
- Project description: Our goal is to develop an explanatory algorithm in which explanations are generated by a generative model. These have the advantage of being prompted, so that we can, as users, instruct it what to generate. For example, we would like to use it to answer questions such as why a given person may or may not receive a loan of a certain value according to a differentiable binary classifier.
## Functions of the files in the repository
- Dockerfile: the docker/running environment for the project
- baseline.py: baseline solution for the project
- curated_gene_disease_associations.tsv: disease-gene association data
- jaccard_baseline_accuracy.txt: accuracy of the baseline model on the test set
- final (folder): GNN solution for the project (results included)
  - final.py: basic GNN solution
  - final_better.py: enhanced GNN solution
  - plot_metrics.py: plots the results of the training in a common graph
  - the other .png and .csv files are the results of these three Python files

## How to run it
The steps below describe the run process for Ubuntu 22.04. operating system release. Make sure that Docker (https://www.docker.com/) is installed on your system before executing the commands below.<br/><br/>
Build the Dockerfile (standing in the directory, where the abovementioned Dockerfile is):
```
docker build -t your_image_name .
```

Start the container with the following command (standing in the directory, where the abovementioned files are):
```
docker run -it --rm --gpus=all -v $(pwd):/home/yourUser your_image_name
```

Inside the container, in bash, add execution rights to the file you want to run:
```
chmod +x make_moons_gan.py
```

Then run the file:
```
./make_moons_gan.py
```
